### Architecture

This API follows a **Layered Architecture** pattern promoting separation of concerns:

- **Routes**: Handle HTTP requests and route them to controllers
- **Controllers**: Process requests and coordinate with services
- **Services**: Implement business logic and rules
- **Repository**: Manage database interactions and data persistence

This structure ensures maintainable, testable, and scalable code following SOLID principles.

### Database Design
PostgreSQL was selected as the database engine due to its robust support for relational data modeling. Its rich feature set makes it particularly well-suited for managing relationships between entities. I used Prisma ORM to streamline database interactions, offering type-safe queries, intuitive schema management, and built-in protection against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.

### Technologies
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL

### Requirements:
- Node +18
- VSCode (recommended editor)
- PostgreSQL and any Database Manager.
- Postman, ThunderClient (Editor extension) or any API Platform.

### Additional dependecies
- zod â€“ Data validation
- jsonwebtoken â€“ Access control
- dotenv â€“ Environment variables
- morgan â€“ HTTP request logging

## Development Setup

1. Start the project by setting up your `.env` file with all required environment variables. This ensures the application has access to essential configuration values like database credentials, API keys, and security tokens.


2. Initial setup for install dependencies

```bash
# /main-directory
$ npm install
```

3. Database setup `schema at ./prisma/schema.prisma`

    1. Create a PostgreSQL database, then update your .env file with the correct connection string. Once configured, run the following command to initialize the Prisma schema:

```bash
# /main-directory
npx prisma migrate dev
```

4. Seed Initial Data `seed at ./prisma/seed.ts`
    
    1. To populate the database with essential configuration and sample data for testing purposes, run the following commands from the projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
# /main-directory
npx prisma db seed
npm run prisma-seed  
```

## Roles and test users

This API defines two distinct roles with different levels of access
- User: Standard access for general application functionality.
- Admin: Include the ability to manage products and deactivate sales.

After run the `Seed Initial Data` command, you will have two users ready for testing:

In login endpoint:

### With user role

```
{
    "username": "testUser",
    "password": "abC.1234",
}
```
### With admin role
```
{
    "username": "testAdmin",
    "password": "abC.1234",
}
```

You can also create custom users. However, if you're creating an admin user, make sure to include the `adminKey` in your request for security purposes. This key must be predefined in your `.env` file before running the application.

When registering users, be aware of the role identifiers:
- User: 1
- Admin: 2

These role IDs are seeded automatically and can be found in the following file `/prisma/seed.ts`

## Run server

```bash
# /main-directory
$ npm run dev
```
